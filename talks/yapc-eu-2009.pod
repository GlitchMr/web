=for Slide
    [Dawning realization: The Web.pm project is like Perl 6 itself.
    Extremely extensible, but the defaults are so sane that you seldom
    need to extend in practice. The defaults are optimized for ease,
    safety, convenience and flexibility. There's a spec (well, there
    should be!) and a test suite (though a really crappy one). It is
    a testing bed for ideas -- we don't really know where we'll end up,
    because we're a bunch of ants. But we're excited, and we're making
    progress.]
