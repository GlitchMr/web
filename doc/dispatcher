Dispatcher
==========
Make posibilites to use different dispatchers.


Grammatics
----------
...


MMD-based
---------

Simple translater request to call:

GET /foo/bar?umh=baz

$app.('GET', 'foo', 'bar', :umh => bar) 
or
$foo.bar(Request::Method.new('GET'), :tags => 'bar')

REST, HTTP-methods as call on the resource:

GET /foo/bar?umh=baz

$resource_foo.GET('bar', :umh('baz'))

Resource is object, with HTTP-methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. Use multi methods to cover or typical resorce manipulations by this methods 

Chains relization:

GET /company/1/offer

$res_company.Link(1, 'offer');
and then
$res_offer.GET('company', Model::Comapny $company);

We can use types and/or first args to set chains compatibility. And this give use flexability to have different chains from the same links.
