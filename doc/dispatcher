Dispatcher
==========
Make possibility to use different dispatchers.


Grammatic
----------
...


MMD-based
---------

Simple translator request to call:

GET /foo/bar?umh=baz

$app.('GET', 'foo', 'bar', :umh => 'baz') 
or
$foo.bar(Request::Method.new('GET'), :tags => 'baz')

REST, call HTTP-methods on the resource:

GET /foo/bar?umh=baz

$resource_foo.GET('bar', :umh('baz'))

Resource is object, with HTTP-methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. Use multi methods to cover typical resource manipulations by this methods. 

Chains realization:

GET /company/1/offer

$res_company.Link(1, 'offer');
and then
$res_offer.GET('company', Model::Company $company);

We can use types and/or some args to set chains compatibility. And this give use flexibility to have different chains from the same links:

GET /company/1/offer
GET /user/23/offer

Can call GET on the Offer with different args.


Actions as regular Objects
