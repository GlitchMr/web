Stages 
=======

ruoso suggestions:

1) receiving a request
that's the "engine" part
it knows how to be triggered for an event
and generates a "Request" object
I, for one, think that Web.pm should be able to handle the engine part standalone if it has to.
in Catalyst the "Request" object is very HTTP-specific
this is something that can be fixed
you can have a much more generic "Request" role
and have a HTTPRequest role to complement it
this "Request" object is the thing that takes us to the second step

2) dispatch
This takes info from $req in order to dispatch
I think the generic request role would provide
has $.uri
has %.params
The mistake in Catalyst in the dispatch part
is to make each dispatch type independent
like it first tries to dispatch "Regex"
if that fails
it tries "Chained"
if thoat fails "Path"
you need a way to provide an unified dispatching
I think the good way of doing it is basically to consider everything "Chained", while support different part matching algorigthms
the third step is actually having no third step
;)
